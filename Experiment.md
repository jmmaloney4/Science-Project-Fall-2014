# Algorithms

### Insetion Sort
  
Insertion Sort sorts a list by taking each element of a list and *Inserting* it into the list in the correct place. This is costlier than Merge Sort, however experimentally, it seems to be more efficent than Bubble Sort. It has a thereoretical time complexity of `O(n^2)`

### Bubble Sort

Bubble Sort goes through the entire list, comparing adjacent elements, and swapping them if needed.
